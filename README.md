# Prediction on total infections for Covid19 - India
In this a Python model has been developed which predicts the cases that upto a week with minimal error.

## About the data
The data is being fetched from an external source https://www.covid19india.org/ which has an API to use and process the data.

More information on the website can be gained from here https://www.covid19india.org/about


## Using Code
I have used [Jupyter-Notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/ "Know more about Jupyter Notebook") to write the code and In order to run the code successfully We would need below mentioned Python packages:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Plotly
* Requests
* Datetime
* Json
* Statsmodel

In the **cell 2** I have placed the configuration variables which can be played with to get different sets of predictions.
